# üç∫ You.i TV Homebrew üç∫
The purpose of this repo is to ensure the proper third party dependencies for the You.i Engine are installed at the correct versions as per `youi-tv doctor`.

## Install Homebrew
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

```

## Installing older formula/casks manually
